# FloatJot

FloatJot is the future of social networking. Traditionally your online posts and status updates are either visible to
everyone or is private. FloatJot aims to make posts location based, meaning that only those who are within a certain distance 
of your post will be able to see it. Furthermore, access to these posts is via Augmented Reality, thus <b>connecting people on a
much more personal level</b>.
